It is tradition to have a list with what the couple needs, but truth is we have
it all plus the cutest small baby. Somehow we got the order of things screwed
up.

If you wish to give us a gift, we would welcome a contribution for a trip for
Lea - it will be to New Zealand and all of you will be entitled to a postcard.
She will be supervised on this trip by her lovely parents, so we'll be 3 :)
