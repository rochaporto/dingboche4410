There will be plenty of nice portuguese food at the wedding, but here are a few
suggestions of portuguese food to try for those travelling and staying for
a few days.

### Francesinha

Francesinha is one of the traditional dishes from Porto, made with bread, wet-cured ham, linguiça, fresh sausage like chipolata, steak or roast meat, and covered with melted cheese and a hot thick tomato and beer sauce.

You can find it in most Cafes and Restaurants, Cufra is a good one.

### Tripas à moda do Porto

First it scares you, then you love it (ok maybe not everyone). These are tripes
Porto style, with white beans, rice and some extra sausages. Give it a go,
worst case you ignore the tripes and love the rest.

### Rojoes à moda do Minho

Rojões are one of the most traditional and unique dishes in Portuguese cuisine. They are basically a combination between fried pork meat and pork rinds.

There are more than 1000 different ways to cook Bacalhau (dry codfish) in
Portugal, so you can even eat it multiple times without getting bored. Try
'assado no forno' (roasted), 'com natas' (with cream) or the more traditional
'Gomes de Sa''.

There will be some at the wedding party :)

### Torrada

Torrada is bread with butter, but with some coffee with milk that's the most
delicious breakfast you can get. Anywhere in Porto.

### Robalo

Plenty of fish options, but Robalo is often especially tasty. In any case,
whatever is fresh that day is likely the best option - ask for it.

### Cozido

Better to have it for lunch as it can be quite filling. Cozido is a Portuguese
boiled, consisting of different kinds of meat, vegetables, potatoes, rice, ...
